- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TannerS1002
- My current interests consist of becoming a software dev for a company that is willing to mold me into a great dev one day
- I have started on the learning route to become a software dev and will continue until I reach my goal

- I originally started as a Paramedic and ended up taking on a more lead role within the hospital system that I was providing for. Coding has always been my dream
- I never knew that there was a way to learn while also potentially creating a life for myself within the world of tech.
